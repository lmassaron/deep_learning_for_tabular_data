# deep_learning_for_tabular_data

Deep Learning can be used also for predictions based on tabular data, the data you most commonly find in databases and in tables. During the presentation session of this workshop it is discussed about how such an approach works and how it is competitive in respect of more popular machine learning algorithms such as gradient boosting. The workshop itself demonstrates how to achieve good results using TensorFlow, it high level API, Keras, integrated with more classical approaches based on Scikit-learn and Pandas.
